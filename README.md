# TASK_1



Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris Dataset
Objective: To explore and understand the characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers of the Iris dataset using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The analysis will include generating visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data.

Steps:

1.Load the Dataset

2.Load the Iris dataset using seaborn.
Examine the Structure of the Dataset

3.Display the first few rows.
Get an overview of the dataset including data types and missing values.
Provide summary statistics for numerical columns.
Visualize the Distributions

4.Create histograms to understand the distribution of each numerical feature.
Create boxplots to identify the spread and potential outliers in each numerical feature.
Check for Correlations

5.Calculate the correlation matrix.
Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.

6.Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between different pairs of numerical features.
Identify and Visualize Outliers

7.Use boxplots to identify and visualize outliers in the dataset.
